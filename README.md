## Building the Project

This project uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just) as a command
runner (similar to `make`). Follow these steps to build the project from
source.

### Prerequisites

- **Go** 1.21 or later
- **just** command runner - Install with:
  ```sh
  # On macOS
  brew install just

  # On Linux
  cargo install just
  # Or download from https://github.com/casey/just/releases
  ```
### Build Steps

1. **Install build tools**

   The project requires several Go-based build tools. Install them all with:
   ```sh
   just tools
   ```

   This installs the following tools into the `bin/` directory:
   - `kustomize` - Kubernetes manifest customization tool
   - `controller-gen` - Kubernetes code and manifest generator
   - `golangci-lint` - Go linter
   - `helm` - Kubernetes package manager
   - `crd-ref-docs` - CRD documentation generator
   - And other supporting tools

   **Note:** If the tools are installed in `hack/bin/` instead of `bin/`, move them:
   ```sh
   mv hack/bin/* bin/ && rmdir hack/bin
   ```

2. **Build all binaries**

   Run the main build command:
   ```sh
   just build
   ```

   This will:
   - Format and vet the Go code
   - Generate Kubernetes CRDs and RBAC manifests
   - Generate API documentation
   - Build all binaries for Linux/amd64:
     - `bin/fabric` - Main controller
     - `bin/agent` - Agent binary
     - `bin/hhfctl` - User-facing CLI tool
     - `bin/fabric-boot` - Boot service
     - `bin/fabric-dhcpd` - DHCP daemon

3. **View available commands**

   See all available build targets:
   ```sh
   just --list
   ```

### Other Useful Commands

- **Run tests**: `just test`
- **Run linters**: `just lint`
- **Build for multiple platforms**: `just build-multi`
- **Build Kubernetes artifacts**: `just kube-build`
- **Generate code/manifests**: `just gen`

## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/fabric:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/fabric:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
