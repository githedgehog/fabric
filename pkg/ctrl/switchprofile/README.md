# Default SwitchProfiles

This package provides a catalog of the default `SwitchProfile` objects supported by the Fabric. It'll be enforced by the
Fabric to ensure the consistency of the switch usages and configurations.

`SwitchProfile` structure is explained in the API package as part of the `SwitchProfile` object definition.

## How to add a new SwitchProfile

To add a new `SwitchProfile`, you need to change the Fabric config in the `ConfigMap` object named `fabric-config` in
the default namespace by adding `allowExtraSwitchProfiles: true` to it so it looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  config.yaml: |
    allowExtraSwitchProfiles: true
    ...
```

### PortGroups and ports belonging to them

It's the most simple setup - just list all the ports with refs to the correct groups.

```console
admin@s5248-01:~$ sonic-cli -c "show port-group | no-more"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Port-group  Interface range            Valid speeds      Default Speed Current Speed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1           Ethernet0 - Ethernet3      10G, 25G          25G           10G
2           Ethernet4 - Ethernet7      10G, 25G          25G           10G
3           Ethernet8 - Ethernet11     10G, 25G          25G           25G
4           Ethernet12 - Ethernet15    10G, 25G          25G           25G
5           Ethernet16 - Ethernet19    10G, 25G          25G           25G
6           Ethernet20 - Ethernet23    10G, 25G          25G           25G
7           Ethernet24 - Ethernet27    10G, 25G          25G           25G
8           Ethernet28 - Ethernet31    10G, 25G          25G           25G
9           Ethernet32 - Ethernet35    10G, 25G          25G           25G
10          Ethernet36 - Ethernet39    10G, 25G          25G           25G
11          Ethernet40 - Ethernet43    10G, 25G          25G           25G
12          Ethernet44 - Ethernet47    10G, 25G          25G           25G
```

### Breakout modes supported by the switch

For the breakouts. offsets need to be specified, it could be done by checking every breakout mode supported by the port
and checking the list of the resulting interface names (using `show interface breakout`).

In case of breakouts, `NOSName` is the actual name to enable breakout mode on the switch (e.g. `1/1` in SONiC), and the
`BaseNOSName` is the NOS name of the base port to be used together with the offset to calculate the actual port name.

```console
admin@s5248-01:~$ sonic-cli -c "show interface breakout modes | no-more"

### Standalone ports without breakout support

For some ports, there are no breakouts and port groups, e.g. Ethernet48-52 on Accton-AS4630-54NPE. In this case, it
seems like there is no easy way to determine the supported port speed and the default one. It could be done by trying to
set port speed on such port going through the full list of accepted values and checking which ones will fail.

```console
as4630-01(config-if-Ethernet48)# speed
  <10/100/1000/2500/5000/10000/20000/25000/40000/50000/100000/200000/400000>  Speed config of the interface
  auto                                                                        Enable auto-negotiation

as4630-01(config-if-Ethernet48)# speed 400000
%Error: Unsupported speed
```

# Testing a new Switch

A new switch either a leaf or spine should be tested as part of these changes.

## Switch Configuration

Some test cases:

0. Ensure that a port can be broken out using the hedgehog fabric. Either
   manually edit the switch object to create a breakout or add connections that
will require a breakout. After the configuration is applied according to the
generations reported by the switch agent confirm the breakout using the sonic
cli via `show interface breakout`

0. Ensure the last "asic" port can be broken out, e.g if the switch claims
   32x100G ports, ensure port 32 can be broken out.

## Passing Traffic

Once the required cabling has been done in the lab we are ready to test passing
traffic. The iperf results should not deviate from the norm, if they do
investigation is needed. Ensure that traffic is not going through the switch
CPU.

### Spines

For testing a new spine it is best to have the spine be the only spine in a
fabric. The fabrics have at least two spines, power off other spines so that
the functionality of the new spine can be quickly determined. Run the standard
ping and iperf3 testing to ensure that traffic is flowing as expected.


### Leafs

A leaf will need similar testing to a spine. Create a VPC attached to leaf and
have the traffic transit the leaf in and out of the VPC. Additionally test that
the leaf allows for Remote VPC peering.
