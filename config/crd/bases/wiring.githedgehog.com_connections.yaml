          Connection object represents a logical and physical connections between any devices in the Fabric (Switch, Server
          and External objects). It's needed to define all physical and logical connections between the devices in the Wiring
          Diagram. Connection type is defined by the top-level field in the ConnectionSpec. Exactly one of them could be used
          in a single Connection object.
