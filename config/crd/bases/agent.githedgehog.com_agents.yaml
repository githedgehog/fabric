          Agent is an internal API object used by the controller to pass all relevant information to the agent running on a
          specific switch in order to fully configure it and manage its lifecycle. It is not intended to be used directly by
          users. Spec of the object isn't user-editable, it is managed by the controller. Status of the object is updated by
          the agent and is used by the controller to track the state of the agent and the switch it is running on. Name of the
          Agent object is the same as the name of the switch it is running on and it's created in the same namespace as the
          Switch object.
